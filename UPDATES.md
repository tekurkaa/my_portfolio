### Version 2

1. Made it look more formal overall. I realized that this is a term long assignment and not a one time work, hence wanted to make a clean webpage that I could even use for other preofessional works.
2. Move around a few things such as my photo to make the content flow look more natural
3. Changed the YouTube video that I had added the link for - for the same reason as to keep it professional. The new video is my personal creation showing my videography skills.
4. Added a new section with my photos to showcase my photography skills on the webpage.
5. Gave the photos a shadow effect to make them look interesting.
6. Added interesting effects to the images such as the image focus effect when hovering over it; just to make the images stand out more!
7. Removed some unneseccary stuff such as random buttons like "Hi! Click me!"
8. Added a navigation bar that will help the viewers to navigate to related pages such as linkein, github, youtube, etc.
9. Fancyfied the navigation bar for better looks.
10. Added section headings for the clarity and viewer understanding.
11. Added a section with my projects to showcase my porfolio.


### Version 3 | Feb 15, 2025
1. Feedback from v2
    * made the image pop up larger
    * highlighted section to separate them from each other
    * changed the way the project headers looked like to avoid confusion with other headers
    * added page sections to the navigation bar

2. Added a feature to display a text box with the location of the images, when you hover over them, using javascript. This provides details about the images.

3. Added another section with an input form that viewers can use to input their name, email id, and a message or a feedback to me. The input and submission is performed using javascript. 
This is just the front end framework with a vision that eventually we could modify the form to take the viewer's entire message and email it to my email directly using the backend link.
4. Added a smooth scroll for the page
5. Added background to the page using Vanta.js
6. Changed the photos used as I loved the new ones better
