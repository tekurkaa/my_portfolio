  <!-- About Me -->

  <section id="about" class="section">
  <h2>About Me &#128104;</h2>
  <hr>

  <p>I am an international student from India at Union College pursuing a <em>Bachelor of Science</em> degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, maintaining a GPA of 3.7 and achieving the Dean's List for three consecutive years.</p>
  <p>My professional journey includes a Data Analyst internship at Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. Ltd., where I worked towards the development of a machine learning-based recommendation system to provide personalized life insurance suggestions, significantly enhancing the customer experience.</p>
  <p>Additionally, during my time as a Quantitative Analyst Intern at CRISIL Ltd., I gained hands-on experience in developing, validating, and testing various quantitative models, achieving over 97% accuracy. My role involved rigorous data analysis, model validation, and the creation of data visualizations to effectively communicate key insights.</p>
  <p>I am passionate about using my computational and analytical skills to solve complex challenges and continuously grow my knowledge in the applications of mathematics and computer science.</p>
  <p> Apart from the academics, some other things I enjoy are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cricket</li>
      <li>Basketball</li>
      <li>Chess</li>
      <li>Weightlifting</li>

  <h2>Projects &#128187;</h2>
  <hr>

  As an aspiring data analyst, most of my projects inlcude collection and analysis of 
  data and building ML models for forecasting or predictions. Below are a few highlights
  from my portfolio:

  <h3 class="project">Predicting bank failure using ML - Altman Z-Score & Stock Price Volatility</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Built predictive models using 24 years of data for 26 public U.S. banks (13 
      failed & 13 non-failed), incorporating stock price volatility, Altman Z-Score trends, 
      and other micro and macroeconomic indicators.</li>
    <li>Achieved 96% predictive accuracy using XGBoost, outperforming Random Forest and 
      Neural Networks, to build a model to forecast bank failures in advance, enhancing 
      risk assessment and early action.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="project">Predicting cryptocurrency prices using ARIMA</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Analyzed 900k+ data points of the cryptocurrency market and built a Python statsmodel 
      ARIMA model for short-term price prediction of Bitcoin with an accuracy of 98%.</li>
    <li>Evaluated and matched price trends for the top 100 cryptocurrencies to build a weighted 
      portfolio, and developed a model to predict its short-term price movements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="project">Predicting weather and climate change using RNN: The PDE Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed a climate forecasting model using Recurrent Neural Networks and partial 
      differential equations, achieving 91% accuracy in predicting key climate variables, such as 
      temperature, precipitation, etc.</li>
    <li>Optimized the machine learning algorithms by training the model with 9-month data 
      (1991 - 2020) over 1000 epochs with TensorFlow, and accurately predicting climate 
      conditions for 3 months.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I am very passionate about photography! Most of the photos I have are taken in my
  mobile phone, but have a very professional look. Below are some of my personal favourites
  from around the world.

  <p>I also have a youtube channel where I post cinematic creations, vlogs, and 
  other informative videos when I get a chance. Here's a sneak peak of one of my 
  cinematic creations that I am proud of.</p>
